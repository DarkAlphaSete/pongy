# Pongy

A crappy pong game while learning LibGDX and Java.
I was learning both at the same time, so the code quality is incredibly crappy, but it "works".

Works on multiple screen resolutions (read: tested on my phone + computer, works with some WORKAROUNDS to my laziness).

Has a two player mode. W/S for left player, UpArrow / DownArrow for right player. The keys can be changed in a settings
file. I originally planned to add a settings screen, but why would I put myself through so much work for a pong clone...

There's also a single player mode. Not the one you're thinking though.
It's just the left player agaisnt a wall. There's a timer that keeps track of the current time, and a best time that
persists through restarts.
