# Pongy

A not-so-good pong clone I made while learning LibGDX and Java.
I was learning both at the same time, so the code quality is really, really not good, but it *works*.

It barely even works with different screen resolutions because I scaled the ball speed to the screen resolution... Yeah, not much more needs to be said.

Has a two player mode. W/S for left player, UpArrow / DownArrow for right player. The keys can be changed in a settings
file. I originally planned to add a settings screen, but due to ~~extreme laziness~~ severe technical limitations I did not implement one.

There's also a single player mode. Not the one you're thinking, though!
It's just the left player agaisnt a wall. There's a timer that keeps track of the current time, and a best time that
persists through restarts. You thought I would go through the work of writing an ***AI***? Hah! Think again!
